Description:

Map initially loads centered on Deschutes Hall at University of Oregon
POI (points of interest) markers load on 3 locations, all buildings in which I have classes this term.
Clicking the POI markers displays a popup stating that I have a class in the building.
Clicking anywhere else on the map will create a marker which displays a popup containing the name and/or address of the location clicked.

Known bugs:

None at this time. Please feel free to try to break it, and leave me a comment
